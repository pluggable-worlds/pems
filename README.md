# pem - Pluggable Extendable Megaverse

PEM is a distributed directory listing for world servers across time and space. It is itself represents a Megaverse. Each PEM instance allows worlds to join and leave at will. Additional worlds are grouped temporarily and spacially. Worlds are expected to register a standard set of criteria and rules for each world.

Each PEM instance is a distributed set of PEM nodes. The nodes themselves operate in a decentralized way hosting Multiverses, Universes, Superclusters, Clusters, Galaxies, and Worlds. The number of servers required depends on the population of players at each level. It is theoretically possible to host a Multiverse through World on one node, but redundancy and high availability is advised.

= Spacial Taxonomy

Worlds are grouped in the following spacial groups:

`World > Galaxy > Cluster > Supercluster > Universe > Multiverse > Megaverse (PEMS instance) > Omniverse (Federated PEMS)`

- World - a specific game world with particular characters, rules, NPCs, etc. The world may have objectives associated with classic video game design, free-for-chat experiences, or anything else the designer desires. Worlds are always 3D/VR navigable via a registered client and sub-client application that visitors/participants can run.
- Galaxy - a grouping of 1 or more worlds that may tie together multiple game worlds along a theme, story, etc. Galaxies are owned by individuals that may allow worlds not designed or maintained by the galaxy owner to appear in said galaxy. Galaxies may or may not be navigable by a 3D/VR client.
- Cluster - a grouping of 1 or more galaxies. Clusters are owned by individuals that may allow galaxies not designed or maintained by the cluster owner to appear in said cluster. Clusters may or may not be navigable by a 3D/VR client.
- Supercluster - a grouping of 1 or more clusters. Superclusters are owned by individuals, allowing clusters not owned by the cluster owner to appear in said cluster.
- Universe - a grouping of 1 or more superclusters. Universes are owned by individuals, allowing superclusters not owned by the supercluster owner to appear in said cluster.
- Multiverse - a grouping of 1 or more universes. A multiverse may contain the same Universe multiple times. Each additional representation is an "alternate universe" or "parallel universe." Alternate universes may represent different periods or drastically different development of the same Universe. Parallel universes closely resemble their sibling universe. A parallel universe may have a sibling universe that is an alternate universe of yet another universe.
- Megaverse - an actual instance of PEM, contains one or more multiverses.
- Omniverse - a federated set of PEWS instances, contains one or more megaverse.

= Temporal Taxonomy

== Universe Year Zero (UYZ)

Worlds through Superclusters inherit their temporal placement from their Universe. A universe is registered to a Multiverse at least one time. The first universe registration starts universe year zero (UYZ). This yearly timescale is Universe specific. Each additional registered Universe may be placed at any offset to the UYZ. Years are universe dependant for time definition. Additionally, it is possible to have other calendar systems specific to any sub-level of a universe within a universe (i.e., a specific culture on a specific world).

== Alternate Universes

Each Universe may declare itself as an alternate universe of any other existing universe - decided at the time of registration. Alternate universes may or may not have the same universe year offset.
